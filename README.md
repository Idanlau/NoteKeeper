# NoteKeeper
Create user, login, and create user specific notes

I created this using python kivy framework. You can create an account, login with the account and write notes and when you login it would give you your spefic's users notes. It works by storing information in the text files Accounts.txt and reading the files when needed. Some bugs might exisit but so far it works as expected.
